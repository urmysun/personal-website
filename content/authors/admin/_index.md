My name is Xiang Liu (pronounced "Shawn Lew"). I am an M.Sc. student at the Non-Invasive Neurostimulation Therapies (NINET) Lab, the University of British Columbia, co-supervised by Dr. Fidel Vila-Rodriguez (M.D., Ph.D., FRCPC, FAPA) and Dr. Z. Jane Wang (Ph.D., IEEE Fellow, FCAE). My research interests include machine learning, data mining, computer vision, and neuroimaging. I am particularly focusing on developing interpretable machine learning models to solve medical problems.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. (Combined Major in Computer Science and Statistics) at the University of British Columbia. Before moving to Canada, I was born and raised up in Chengdu. I graduated from Chengdu No. 7 High School in 2011.
